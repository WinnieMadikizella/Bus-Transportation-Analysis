# Bus Transportation Analysis Dashboard
An automated, interactive Excel dashboard analyzing bus transportation trends, usage, and performance to support operational decision-making.
Built using Excel with Power Query and PivotTables, this solution is designed to allow you to simply refresh the data as new information becomes available, instantly updating all visuals, KPIs, and insights.
This project transforms raw transportation data into dynamic, decision-ready intelligence for better planning and resource allocation.

Excited to share my latest project: an **automated Bus Transportation Analysis dashboard built in Excel!**  
This project extracts actionable insights from transportation data, enabling decision-makers to make informed decisions and optimize operations.
Excel, when paired with automation and a solid data model, becomes a powerful tool for real-time decision support.

## Key Questions Addressed:
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Bus Utilization:** Identifying the busiest and least busy routes  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Peak and Off-Peak Hours:** Determining the most and least congested times of operation  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Year-over-Year Changes:** Analyzing trends and identifying areas for improvement

## Insights Revealed:
‚úÖ The most congested route is the **East-West Express**, while the least congested is the **South Line**  
‚úÖ The **peak time** of operation is **8:57 PM**, while the **off-peak** is **7:50 PM**  
‚úÖ **Bus Utilization:**
- 24% Over-utilized  
- 22% Under-utilized  
- 45% Moderately-utilized  
- 9% Well-utilized  
‚úÖ **Year-over-year change** is **-83.50%**, highlighting the need for strategic action

## Why This Matters:
üìà **Automated reporting** means less manual work and more time for **strategic decision-making**
üöç **Route optimization** and **resource allocation** based on live, updated data
üòä Enhanced **service efficiency** and **customer satisfaction**  
üí≤ Opportunities for **cost reduction** and **revenue growth**

## Data Model
The dashboard is built on a structured star schema for efficient reporting and automated refresh in Excel Power Pivot.  

 **Schema Overview:**
- **Fact Table:** `Facttable_ridership` ‚Äî Tracks each bus trip, rider, date, and utilization  
- **Dimensions:**  
  - `Dim_routes` ‚Äî Route details  
  - `Dim_buses` ‚Äî Bus capacity & route link  
  - `Dim_demographics` ‚Äî Rider age, gender, occupation  
  - `Dim_DateTable` ‚Äî Calendar metadata  
  - `Calculations` ‚Äî DAX measures used in the dashboard
